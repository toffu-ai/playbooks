I want to write a blog post that compares between two products.

Ask me for the two products I want to compare, then:

1. Research high volume/low difficulty keywords for this blog post in order to embed them naturally in the content.
2. Write an outline with the keywords in the H2 headlines
3. Wait for my approval for the outline

Once I approve the outline, write the content with these guidelines:

1. Fetch G2 ratings and reviews for the two products
2. Fetch Reddit comments for the two products
3. Embed the data you find in the blog post
4. Do not use the usual AI-generated structure of text->bullet points->text , mix things up.
5. Include notable quotes and hyperlink the sources as blockquotes.
6. Do not make up people or companies, only use real world examples, people, and companies. 

Once I approve the blog post, humanize the content by using the humanizer tool.

Provide me with the blog post in markdown.
